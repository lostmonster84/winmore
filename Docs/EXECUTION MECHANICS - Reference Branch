## POSITION SIZE CALCULATION

### DYNAMIC SIZING FORMULA
```
Standard Position (5%): Current Account Value × 0.05
Exceptional Position (10%): Current Account Value × 0.10

Examples:
£35,000 account × 5% = £1,750 position
£42,000 account × 5% = £2,100 position
£28,000 account × 10% = £2,800 position (exceptional only)
```

### NEVER USE FIXED AMOUNTS
❌ Wrong: "Always use £1,500 positions"
✅ Right: "Always calculate 5% of current balance"

**Why:** As account grows, position sizes should grow proportionally

## TRADING 212 STEP-BY-STEP EXECUTION

### PLACING A BUY ORDER

**Step 1: Calculate Position Size**
- Check current account balance in Trading 212
- Calculate 5% (standard) or 10% (exceptional score 8-10)
- Write down the £ amount before starting

**Step 2: Find the Stock**
- Type ticker symbol in search box
- Click on stock name to open details
- Click "BUY" button (large blue button)

**Step 3: Order Details**
- **Order Type:** Market Order (for immediate execution)
- **Quantity:** Click "£" tab (not shares tab)
- **Amount:** Enter your calculated £ position size
- **Stop Loss:** Set to -5% from current price
- **Take Profit:** Set to +10% from current price

**Step 4: Review Before Execution**
- Double-check position size matches calculation
- Confirm stop loss is -5% 
- Confirm take profit is +10%
- Review estimated FX costs (if US stock)

**Step 5: Execute**
- Click "BUY" to execute
- Screenshot confirmation for records
- Note exact entry time and price

### SETTING STOPS AND TARGETS

**Automatic Setup (Recommended):**
- Set stop and target when placing initial order
- Trading 212 will execute automatically
- No emotion involved in exit decisions

**Manual Setup (If needed):**
1. Go to "Portfolio" tab
2. Find your position
3. Click the "gear" icon next to position
4. Select "Stop Loss" → Set at -5%
5. Select "Take Profit" → Set at +10%
6. Save both orders

### ORDER TYPES EXPLAINED

**Market Order:**
- Executes immediately at current market price
- Use for entries when setup is clear
- Small slippage acceptable for speed

**Limit Order:**
- Only executes at your specified price or better
- Use if stock moving fast and you want specific entry
- Risk: might not fill if price gaps away

**For Win More System: Use Market Orders**
- Speed of execution > penny optimization
- Setups are time-sensitive
- -5% stop protects against bad fills

## COMMON EXECUTION ERRORS TO AVOID

### POSITION SIZING ERRORS
❌ "£2,000 feels about right" → Use calculated amount
❌ "I'll round up to £2,500" → Stick to 5% exactly  
❌ "This one's really good, £4,000" → 10% maximum, only score 8-10
❌ "I'll use yesterday's calculation" → Always use current balance

### STOP LOSS ERRORS
❌ Setting stop at -7% ("bit more room") → Always -5%
❌ Moving stop lower after entry → Never move stops down
❌ "I'll set it later" → Set immediately with order
❌ Using mental stops → Must be actual orders in system

### TARGET ERRORS  
❌ "I'll see how it goes" → Always set +10% target
❌ "Maybe I'll hold for +15%" → Stick to mechanical +10%
❌ Moving target higher → Take profits mechanically
❌ "Just a bit more..." → Greed destroys consistency

### TIMING ERRORS
❌ Trading before 3:00 PM → Wait 30 minutes after open
❌ Trading on news reactions → Let initial moves settle
❌ Taking 4th trade of day → Maximum 3 trades daily
❌ Trading when confused → Skip unclear setups

## FX COSTS AND ISA OPTIMIZATION

### FX COSTS (US Stocks)
- **Cost:** 0.15% each way (0.30% round trip)
- **Example:** £2,000 position = £6 round trip cost
- **Factor into targets:** Still profitable at +10%

### ISA vs INVEST ACCOUNT
**Use ISA for:**
- Growth stocks (higher volatility)
- Larger position sizes
- Tax-free gains (£20,000 annual limit)

**Use INVEST for:**
- Positions over ISA limit
- Conservative dividend stocks
- International diversification

### TRADING HOURS OPTIMIZATION
**Pre-market (1:00-2:30 PM BST):**
- Review overnight news
- Identify potential setups
- Calculate position sizes
- NO TRADING until market open

**Market Hours (2:30-9:00 PM BST):**
- Wait until 3:00 PM for first trades
- Execute setups between 3:00-8:00 PM
- Avoid last 30 minutes (choppy)

**After Hours:**
- Review trades
- Update tracking
- Plan tomorrow
