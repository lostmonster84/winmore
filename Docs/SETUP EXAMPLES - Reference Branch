## SETUP 1: OVERSOLD QUALITY BOUNCE (70% Win Rate)

- **Trigger:** Down 12% on market fear (no company news)
- **Entry:** $165 after RSI hit 35, bounced off 200-day MA
- **Technical:** Clear support, volume spike on bounce day
- **Exit:** $181.50 (+10%) after 5 days
- **Why it worked:** Quality company, temporary fear, strong support level

- **Trigger:** Down 9% on sector rotation fears
- **Entry:** $385 after stabilization, RSI 38
- **Technical:** Above all major MAs, just fear-based selling
- **Exit:** $423.50 (+10%) after 4 days
- **Why it worked:** No fundamental issues, oversold on technicals

### TRAP EXAMPLES (Looked Good But Failed)

**Trap 1: META October 2023**

**Trap 2: NFLX June 2024**
- **Looked good:** Down 13% on market selloff, RSI 33
- **The problem:** Below 200-day MA, broken technical structure
- **Result:** Hit -5% stop, continued down another 8%
- **Lesson:** Must be above major support levels

- **January:** Start with Setup 1 (easiest to spot)
- **February:** Move to Setup 2 (earnings season creates setups)
- **March:** Try Setup 3 (earnings reactions)
- **Continue rotating** until you find your best setup

**Master one before moving to next - consistency beats complexity**
