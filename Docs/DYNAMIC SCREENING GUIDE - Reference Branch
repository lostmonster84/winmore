## DYNAMIC SCREENING WORKFLOW

### STEP 1: ASSESS CURRENT MARKET STATE (2 minutes)

**Real-Time Market Context Check:**
```
1. Current VIX: _____ (Look up live reading)
2. SPY/QQQ trend: _____ (5-day and 20-day performance)  
3. Current time: _____ (UK time, market status)
4. Recent volatility: _____ (Compare VIX to 20-day average)
5. Sector rotation: _____ (What's moving today?)
```

**Dynamic Environment Classification:**
- **Low Vol/Uptrend:** Few opportunities, be very selective
- **Low Vol/Sideways:** Rare setups, focus on quality
- **Medium Vol/Any direction:** Normal setup scanning
- **High Vol/Any direction:** Many opportunities, be systematic
- **Crisis/Panic:** Maximum opportunities, deploy carefully

### STEP 2: SELECT OPTIMAL SETUP FOCUS

**Current Condition → Best Setup Mapping:**
```
IF VIX >21 AND many stocks down 8-15% → Focus: Setup 1 (Oversold)
IF Earnings season active AND reactions >10% → Focus: Setup 3 (Earnings)
IF Strong uptrend AND technical setups clean → Focus: Setup 2 (Support)  
IF Major sector selloffs occurring → Focus: Setup 4 (Sympathy)
IF Significant gaps at open → Focus: Setup 5 (Gap Fill)
IF Mixed conditions → Adaptive: Take best available
```

**Real-Time Setup Prioritization:**
1. **Scan all 5 setups** for current availability (30 seconds each)
2. **Rank by current market fit** (which has most candidates?)
3. **Choose primary focus** for this session
4. **Keep secondary backup** if primary produces nothing

## ADAPTIVE SETUP SCREENING

### SETUP 1: OVERSOLD BOUNCE (Dynamic Conditions)

**When This Setup Works Best:**
- VIX >19 (fear present)

**Real-Time Screening Process:**
1. **Finviz Screener:** Market Cap >$2B, Price >$20, RSI <40, Daily performance <-8%
2. **Current Context Filter:** Remove any with company-specific news
3. **VIX Adjustment:** If VIX >25, can accept RSI up to 45 (more opportunity)
4. **Dynamic Threshold:** If VIX <17, require RSI <35 (be more selective)

**Live Market Examples (Update Daily):**
- Check current biggest losers in S&P 500
