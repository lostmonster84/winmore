CURRENT SITUATION:
- VIX at 17.53 (complacent)
- Need VIX >20 to deploy (not 25!)
- September weakness may take VIX to 20-22
- VIX 25+ unlikely without crisis event

YOUR RESPONSE:
- Stay 80% cash as planned
- Watch for VIX crossing 20
- Deploy 5% positions at VIX 20+
- Don't wait for VIX 25 (may never come)
- Individual stock crashes matter more than VIX

✅ SECTION 8: IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST
IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
□ Update all VIX triggers in your playbooks to new levels□ Add RSI requirement: Any "oversold" claim must include RSI(14, daily) exact value and one confluence factor (50/200‑DMA, prior support, AVWAP, or volume confirmation)□ Set new alerts:
VIX crosses above 19 (warning)
VIX crosses above 20 (deploy)
VIX crosses above 22 (aggressive) □ Delete old VIX 25/30/35 alerts (unrealistic)□ Adjust position sizing triggers to new VIX levels□ Update your daily monitoring routine□ Accept that VIX 20 is your new action point
YOUR NEW SEPTEMBER TRADING RULES:
Base Case: 80% cash regardless of VIX
VIX hits 20: Can deploy up to 3 trades at 5% each
VIX hits 22: Can increase to 10% positions
Maximum deployment: 20% of portfolio in September
Focus: Individual stock opportunities over market-wide VIX

📝 FINAL NOTES
WHY THIS UPDATE MATTERS:
The Old World (Pre-2020):
VIX regularly hit 25-30
Volatility cycles were larger
Crisis events more impactful
Waiting for VIX 25 made sense
The New World (2025):
Central banks intervene faster
Volatility suppressed structurally
VIX 20 is now "high fear"
VIX 25+ only in black swans
Must adapt or miss all opportunities
THE BOTTOM LINE:
Your playbooks were built for a different market regime. This update makes them functional for 2025's low-volatility environment. Without these changes, you'll be waiting forever for opportunities that rarely come.
Remember: It's better to adapt to reality than to wait for conditions that no longer exist.
