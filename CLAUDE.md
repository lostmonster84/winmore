## POSITION SIZING CALCULATOR & RISK TOOLS
**Position Size Formula:** (Portfolio Value × Risk%) ÷ Entry Price  
**Example:** £30,000 × 10% = £3,000 position | £3,000 ÷ £50/share = 60 shares

**Risk Management Matrix:**
- **A-Grade Setup (15%):** Max position = £4,500 at £30K portfolio
- **B-Grade Setup (10%):** Max position = £3,000 at £30K portfolio  
- **C-Grade Setup (5%):** Max position = £1,500 at £30K portfolio
- **NEVER exceed 20%** = £6,000 max single position

**Stop Loss Calculator:**  
**Entry £50, -5% stop = £47.50 | Risk per share = £2.50**  
**Max shares for 5% portfolio risk:** £1,500 ÷ £2.50 = 600 shares  
**Actual position value:** 600 × £50 = £30,000 (100% - TOO BIG!)**  
**Correct sizing:** £1,500 ÷ £50 = 30 shares for 5% risk

**Daily Risk Limits:**  
- **Maximum 3 new positions per day**
- **Total portfolio risk <50% in single day**  
- **No position >20% of total capital**
- **Keep 20-40% cash for opportunities**

## EMERGENCY PROTOCOLS
**If Portfolio Drops >10% in Single Day:**
1. STOP all new entries immediately
2. Review all stop losses - tighten if needed
3. Cut any position showing >15% loss
4. Raise cash to 70%+ for next opportunity
5. Wait for VIX ≥21 before re-deploying
