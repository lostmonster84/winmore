## 🎯 The Win More Methodology

4. **One Setup Focus** - Master one pattern per month
5. **Mechanical Execution** - +10% profit target, -5% stop loss
6. **Maximum 3 Trades/Day** - Quality over quantity

### The 5 Setup System
1. **Oversold Quality Bounce** - High-probability reversals
2. **Support Level Plays** - Technical support entries  
3. **Earnings Momentum** - Post-earnings continuation
4. **Sympathy Plays** - Sector momentum trades
5. **Gap Fill Opportunities** - Mean reversion setups

### Seasonal Allocation Calendar
- **September**: 30% deployed (survival mode)
- **October**: 50% deployed (building exposure)
- **November**: 80% deployed (opportunity season)
- **December-August**: Variable based on market conditions

## 🧠 VIX Opportunity Assessment

Your deployment scale integrated:
- **VIX <15**: Low opportunity - minimal exposure
- **VIX 15-19**: Normal conditions - standard positions
- **VIX 19-23**: Elevated opportunity - increase deployment
- **VIX 23+**: High opportunity - maximum focus on A+ setups
