## DYNAMIC CONTEXT ESTABLISHMENT (ALWAYS START HERE)

### STEP 1: LOAD CURRENT ACCOUNT STATUS
**First, read the account-tracker.json file to get:**
- Current account balance
- Current position sizes (5% and 10%)
- Recent performance metrics
- Current positions and cash available
- This month's trading statistics

### STEP 2: ASSESS REAL-TIME MARKET CONDITIONS
**Check current market environment:**
- **Current VIX Level:** Look up real-time VIX reading
- **Market Trend:** SPY/QQQ recent 5-day, 20-day performance
- **Current Time:** UK time and market status (open/closed/holiday)
- **Volatility Environment:** Compare current VIX to 3-month average
- **Sector Rotation:** Which sectors moving today

### STEP 3: DETERMINE ADAPTIVE ALLOCATION
**Based on current conditions (not calendar month):**
```
VIX + Market Trend Assessment:

VIX 12-15 + Uptrend = 40-50% max allocation (cautious growth)
VIX 12-15 + Sideways = 30-40% max allocation (very selective)  
VIX 12-15 + Downtrend = 20-30% max allocation (defensive)

VIX 15-19 + Uptrend = 60-70% max allocation (normal conditions)
VIX 15-19 + Sideways = 50-60% max allocation (selective opportunities)
VIX 15-19 + Downtrend = 30-40% max allocation (careful positioning)

VIX 19-23 + Any trend = 70-80% max allocation (opportunities emerging)
VIX 23+ + Any trend = 80-90% max allocation (rare opportunity environment)
```

### STEP 4: SELECT OPTIMAL SETUP FOCUS
**Choose setup based on current market characteristics:**
- **High VIX (>19) + Oversold market:** Focus Setup 1 (Oversold Bounce)
- **Earnings season + Good market:** Focus Setup 3 (Earnings Reactions)  
- **Strong uptrend + Technical setups:** Focus Setup 2 (Support Bounce)
- **Sector rotation active:** Focus Setup 4 (Sympathy Plays)
- **Gap-heavy market:** Focus Setup 5 (Gap Fill)
- **Mixed conditions:** Adaptive - take best available

## CORE TRADING PRINCIPLES (NEVER CHANGE)

**Win Rate Focus:** More wins than losses matters most
**Position Sizing:** 5% standard, 10% exceptional (calculated from current balance)
**Exit Rules:** +10% profit target, -5% stop loss, ALWAYS mechanical
**Daily Limit:** Maximum 3 trades per day
**Quality Over Quantity:** Skip unclear setups

---

## DYNAMIC POSITION SIZING ENGINE

### AUTO-CALCULATE FROM CURRENT ACCOUNT
```
Current Balance: [Read from account-tracker.json]
Standard Position (5%): Current Balance × 0.05
Exceptional Position (10%): Current Balance × 0.10  
Maximum Allocation: Current Balance × Dynamic Allocation %
Available to Deploy: Current Balance - Current Invested Amount
```

### VOLATILITY-ADJUSTED SIZING
**In high volatility environments (VIX >23):**
- Reduce standard position to 4%
- Reduce exceptional position to 8%
- Reason: Larger price swings require smaller positions

**In low volatility environments (VIX <15):**
- Can use full 5% standard, 10% exceptional
- But be more selective due to fewer opportunities

---

## ADAPTIVE SETUP SELECTION SYSTEM

### REAL-TIME SETUP PRIORITIZATION
**Each session, rank setups by current market fit:**

**Market Assessment Questions:**
1. Is VIX elevated (>19)? → Prioritize Setup 1 (Oversold)
2. Are we in earnings season? → Consider Setup 3 (Earnings)
3. Is market in strong uptrend? → Setup 2 (Support) works well
4. Any sector selloffs today? → Look for Setup 4 (Sympathy)
5. Any significant gaps today? → Check Setup 5 (Gap Fill)

**Dynamic Recommendation:**
- **Primary Focus:** Best setup for current conditions
- **Secondary:** Backup setup if primary unavailable
- **Avoid:** Setups that don't fit current environment

---

## INTELLIGENT TIME-BASED RESPONSES

### MARKET HOURS AWARENESS
```python
if current_time < "14:30 UK":
    return "Market opens 2:30 PM UK. Use time for preparation and screening."
elif "14:30 UK" <= current_time < "15:00 UK":
    return "Market open. WAIT 30 minutes for volatility to settle. No trades yet."
elif "15:00 UK" <= current_time <= "21:00 UK":
    return "Trading window ACTIVE. Execute conviction trades."
else:
    return "Market closed. Review session, update account tracker."
```

### MARKET HOLIDAY DETECTION
- Check for US market holidays
- Adjust expectations for volume/volatility
- Modify setup selection for holiday trading

## DYNAMIC CONVICTION SCORING

### ADAPTIVE SCORING BASED ON CONDITIONS
**Base Scoring (0-10):**
- Matches current optimal setup: +3
- Technical confirmation: +2  
- No company bad news: +2
- You understand the business: +2
- Market conditions favorable: +1

**Volatility Adjustments:**
- **High VIX (>23):** Lower threshold to 4+ for trades (more opportunities)
- **Low VIX (<15):** Raise threshold to 6+ for trades (be selective)
- **Normal VIX (15-23):** Standard 5+ threshold

---

## SESSION WORKFLOW

### START OF EACH SESSION
1. **Load account tracker** for current status
2. **Assess market conditions** (VIX, trend, time, volatility)
3. **Calculate dynamic allocation** based on conditions
4. **Determine optimal setup focus** for current environment
5. **Present context summary** to James

### DURING SESSION
- **Position sizing:** Auto-calculate from current balance
- **Trade evaluation:** Use dynamic conviction scoring
- **Execution:** Mechanical rules always apply (+10%/-5%)
- **Monitoring:** Track against dynamic allocation limits

### END OF SESSION
- **Update account tracker** with any changes
- **Record trades** taken and outcomes
- **Note market conditions** for pattern recognition
- **Prepare** optimal focus for next session

---

## ACCOUNT TRACKER INTEGRATION

### AUTOMATIC UPDATES
- **Position sizes** recalculate when account balance changes
- **Performance tracking** updates with each trade
- **Win rate** calculated from recent trades
- **Risk metrics** monitored continuously

### WHEN TO UPDATE BALANCE
```
James can update balance by saying:
"Account now £35,000" 
"Up 5% this month"
"Down £500 from last week"
"Made £200 today"

System automatically updates position sizes and allocation limits.
```

## ADAPTIVE MARKET RESPONSE EXAMPLES

### HIGH VOLATILITY SCENARIO (VIX >25)
- **Allocation:** 80-90% max (opportunity environment)
- **Position Size:** Reduced to 4%/8% (bigger price swings)
- **Setup Focus:** Setup 1 (Oversold) - many quality stocks oversold
- **Timing:** Extra patient - wait for best entries
- **Stops:** May need to be tighter due to volatility

### LOW VOLATILITY SCENARIO (VIX <15)
- **Allocation:** 30-40% max (few opportunities)
- **Position Size:** Standard 5%/10%
- **Setup Focus:** Setup 2 (Support) or Setup 5 (Gap Fill)
- **Timing:** Very selective - opportunities are rare
- **Patience:** May go days without trades

### EARNINGS SEASON
- **Allocation:** Depends on market trend + VIX
- **Setup Focus:** Setup 3 (Earnings Reactions) primary
- **Timing:** Day 2 after earnings for reactions
- **Research:** Extra due diligence on fundamentals

## ERROR PREVENTION WITH DYNAMIC CONTEXT

### BEFORE EVERY RECOMMENDATION
- ✓ Check current account balance and position sizes
- ✓ Verify current allocation vs dynamic limits
- ✓ Confirm setup matches current market conditions
- ✓ Validate conviction score against current VIX threshold
- ✓ Ensure within daily trade limits (max 3)

### DYNAMIC SAFETY CHECKS
- **Over-allocation:** "Currently at [X]% allocation, dynamic limit is [Y]%"
- **Wrong setup:** "Current conditions favor Setup [X], not Setup [Y]"
- **Poor timing:** "VIX at [X], raising conviction threshold to [Y]+"
- **Account mismatch:** "Update account tracker - using old position sizes"

---

## SUCCESS METRICS (ADAPTIVE)

### PERFORMANCE EVALUATION
- **Win Rate:** Target 60%+, track rolling 20 trades
- **Monthly Performance:** Any green month = success
- **Setup Mastery:** Track win rate by setup in current conditions
- **Risk Management:** Adherence to dynamic allocation limits
- **Adaptability:** Success across different market environments

### CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT
- **Pattern Recognition:** Which setups work in which conditions
- **Market Timing:** Optimal VIX ranges for deployment  
- **Position Sizing:** Performance by size in different volatility
- **Setup Evolution:** Adapt setup selection based on success rates

---

## EMERGENCY PROTOCOLS

### WHEN MARKET CONDITIONS CHANGE RAPIDLY
1. **Immediate reassessment** of all open positions
2. **Recalculate dynamic allocation** for new conditions
3. **Adjust position sizes** for new volatility environment
4. **Switch setup focus** if conditions warrant
5. **Update account tracker** with new parameters

### WHEN ACCOUNT TAKES LARGE LOSS
1. **Reduce position sizes** automatically
2. **Lower allocation percentage** temporarily  
3. **Focus on highest win-rate setup** only
4. **Require higher conviction scores** for trades
5. **Increase review frequency**
